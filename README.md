# Linear Neural Network Chatbot

## Overview
The Linear Neural Network Chatbot is an intelligent conversational agent designed to accurately interpret user intents and entities. Leveraging a linear neural network architecture, this chatbot offers precise understanding of user queries, enabling seamless interactions and responses.

## Key Features
- Utilizes a linear neural network for accurate interpretation of user intents and entities.
- Employs real-time information retrieval to provide up-to-date and accurate responses.
- Guides users through different conversation paths based on their queries.
- Deployed using Flask for seamless integration into web applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK)
- Web development skills (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for integrating the chatbot into web applications

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Train the linear neural network model using labeled data to recognize user intents and entities.
4. Implement real-time information retrieval mechanisms to ensure responses are up-to-date.
5. Deploy the chatbot using Flask to integrate it into web applications.
6. Customize conversation paths and responses based on user queries and intents.

## Privacy and Security
- Implement privacy measures to protect user data and conversations.
- Adhere to privacy regulations and guidelines when handling sensitive information.
- Consider anonymizing user data or using encryption techniques to safeguard privacy.
